EXT2 Filesystem single-block boot-loader

Build: cc -o bootext2 bootext2.c

This will compile 'bootext2', the installer program.  Run it without
arguments for instructions.

This is a single record boot loader which fits in the first 1K of ext2
filesystems.  It understands the ext2 filesystem, so no 'sys'-like (or
lilo-like) command is needed when you install a new kernel.  Instead, you
just copy the kernel to root.  It is a single-stage boot program- everything
is in the first record.

Limitations:

- It uses bios int13 calls to access the drive.  Therefore, it can only
  deal with drives with parameters in the following ranges:
    sectors per track: 1 - 63
    heads/sides: 1 - 256
    cylinders: 1-1024

- It does not pass any information to Linux.  You must use 'rdev' to tell
  linux which drive it will use for root.  Also you can not pass any
  command line parameters with this boot loader.
