FAT Filesystem single-sector boot-loader

Build: cc -o bootfat bootfat.c

This will compile 'bootfat', the installer program.  Run it without
arguments for instructions.

This is a single record boot loader which fits in the first 512 bytes of
MS-DOS/FAT filesystems.  It understands the fat filesystem, so no 'sys'-like
(or lilo-like) command is needed whever you install a new kernel.  All you
have to do it copy the kernel to root.  It is a single-stage boot program-
everything is in the first record.

Limitations:

- It uses bios int13 calls to access the drive.  Therefore, it can only
  deal with drives with parameters in the following ranges:
    no. sectors per track: 1 - 63
    no. heads/sides: 1 - 256
    no. cylinders: 1-1024

- It does not pass any information to Linux.  You must use 'rdev' to tell
  linux which drive it will use for root.  Also you can not pass any
  command line parameters with this boot loader.

Notes:

- If you use this on your hard drive, be sure to first make a bootable
  MS-DOS disk with a copy of fdisk.exe on it.  If you should decide to
  make the drive DOS bootable again, you can boot from the floppy and
  and run: fdisk /mbr
