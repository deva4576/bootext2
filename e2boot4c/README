e2boot is a boot block which understands the ext2 filesystem enough to boot
from a pathname, and with keyboard input, timeout, and default.
e2boot also collects a parameter string to pass to the kernel.
e2boot detects and uses BIOS support for Enhanced Disk Drive
to allow booting beyond cylinder 1024 and beyond 8GB.
Most BIOS dated after mid-1995 have support for Enhanced Disk Drive; see
	http://www.phoenix.com/techs/specs.html # edd2c.pdf
e2boot handles zImage (loads at 64K) or bzImage (loads at >= 1M) kernels,
and initial RAM disks, including hard links and symbolic links within
the partition being booted.

In order to fit all of this functionality into 1024 bytes, e2boot4c
requires that the Master Boot Record supply a subroutine to read the disk.
mbr03.tgz contains such a MBR.  If you want to use a different MBR,
then edit e2boot.a86 and select a different major configuration
(USE_PTAB or USE_LABEL instead of USE_MBR).  Not using mbr03 typically
requires getting along without symbolic links (use hard links instead),
and living with shorter pathnames (such as "/L" and "/I" for the
Linux kernel and the initial RAM disk, both as hard links [or actual files]).

e2boot does not set kernel parameters for root, swap, or VGA devices,
so use /usr/sbin/rdev to set the right ones.  Or, use parameters in
the boot command string.  e2boot's installer diagnoses the current
values as a reminder.

e2boot uses 32-bit registers, and therefore requires a 386 or higher,
just like Linux.
