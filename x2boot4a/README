bootext2 is a boot block which understands the ext2 filesystem
enough to boot from a pathname, and with keyboard input, timeout, and
default.  bootext2 also collects a parameter string to pass to the
kernel.  bootext2 detects and uses BIOS support for Enhanced Disk Drive
to allow booting beyond cylinder 1024.  (Most BIOS dated after mid-1995
have this.)  bootext2 boots "low" at 0x10000 (64KB), and is suitable
for compressed kernels such as /boot/vmlinuz.  bootext2 can be used to make
a bootable ext2-formatted floppy.

bootext2 v4a has three major configuration options to deal with how
the Master Boot Record tells bootext2 which partition is being booted.
The default option (USE_PTAB) works with most MBR from Microsoft and IBM.
There also are options to use the MBR from mbr02.tgz (USE_MBR),
or for use with FAT volume label and/or floppy disk (USE_LABEL, USE_FLOPPY).
The visible effects are how many characters are allowed for boot parameters
(from 59 to 175), and whether bootext2 handles symbolic links (it does
with USE_PART or USE_MBR).

bootext2 does not set kernel parameters for root or swap devices,
so use /usr/sbin/rdev to get the right ones, or use parameters in
the boot command string.  bootext2's installer diagnoses the current
values as a reminder.

bootext2 uses 32-bit registers, and therefore requires a 386 or higher,
just like Linux.
