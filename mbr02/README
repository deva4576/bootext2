This is a boot manager which boots from primary and logical partitions,
including those beyond the 528MB (1024 cylinder) limit, and multiple drives.
If the BIOS date is mid-1995 or newer, then the BIOS probably handles
large disks using LBA (linear block addressing) via INT 0x13 with AH=0x42.
If the BIOS date is early 1996 or newer, then the BIOS may supervise
booting from multiple drives.  MBR interfaces with these BIOS facilities,
but does so dynamically so that MBR still functions with older BIOSes.
However, if the BIOS does not support the newer interfaces, then MBR
might be restricted to primary and logical partitions on the first 1024
cylinders of the first hard drive.

As with any software which modifies your boot sector, use caution.  Backup
your files.  Back up your boot sector (dd </dev/hda >backup count=1 bs=512).
Make boot floppies.  You get the idea.

MBR packs a lot into only 440 bytes, so its interface is spartan.
A typical console and keyboard dialog might look like

  a:dos		selection letter : user-specified label
  b:OS/2
  c:swap
  d*linux	asterisk indicates default partition to boot
  e:usr
  f:home
  g:src
  :d		prompt for selection letter; 'd' entered to boot linux

Then the partition list repeats until the selected partition 'd'
is reached; that partition's boot block is then read and executed.
The default drive is the one chosen by the BIOS.  The default partition
is chosen when MBR is installed.  Entering \r also selects the default.
Keyboard input offers timeout and a no-wait mode.  The selection letters
must be consecutive, but can begin with any characater.

MBR can be tested from a floppy without modifying the existing
master boot record on the hard drive.

MBR can also make a machine-independent "universal" boot floppy
that lists sizes instead of label strings.  The five-digit number
is the decimal partition size in megabytes:

  mbr02		splash screen
  :1              prompt for drive number; '1' entered for 1st hard drive

  06:00012:a:	type byte in hex : decimal megabytes : selection letter :
  07:00350:b:
  82:00070:c:
  83:00050:d:
  83:00060:e:
  83:00400:f:
  83:00300:g:
  :		  prompt for partition selection

Use of MBR as the master boot record does not remove the need
for each bootable partition to have its own boot block.
Linux users still need LILO (or bootext2) in the boot block.

MBR uses 32-bit registers, and therefore requires a 386 or higher,
just like Linux.
